main.cpp contains 2 player tic-tac-toe terminal game
The idea is to create a program that will master playing ttt by playing aginst itself
There are 9 places with 3 options creating 3^9 statees although few of them are repeated but I am not considering it here
Total states = 19683
Each place can have 0 1 2 corresponding to <space> X and 0
The index of a state is determined polynomially, we need to get the best move for each state
The input for state index should be matrix player 1 or player 2, player 1 writes X and 2 writes 0
At any state there are 9 moves and only some of them are valid, we'll store  the probability of winning after each move. Probability is -1 if the move is invalid.
We also store how many times each move has been tried so the data becomes

State-index, total-moves , last-move , wins-move-1 , wins-move-2.... , draws-move-1....

in a file named state-<index>.txt
